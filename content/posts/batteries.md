In which four interpid nerds attempt to subvert battery copy-protection

### Background

We went for a capacity upgrade (51 -> 62Wh) when swapping out my friend's battery. Dell bios does not like the non-dell battery; the idea is to graft the old battery's management system (BMS) onto the new battery.

#### First Hurdle

The casings are different; the old one has clips on the side for disassembly and the new one is pure adhesive. Solution: destroy the new case[^1] and use the old one to store the four-phone-batteries-in-a-trenchcoat rig.

(new casing "teardown" vs old casing+backing)

#### Second Hurdle

New BMS contains a plastic power rail connecting to each of the batteries; old BMS connects to an isolated power rail. We have graft the isolated power rail:

The old hydrogen-bloated batteries, the orange isolated power rail, and the minimal BMS chip. Note the inverted middle batteries. We were very concerned by the presence of a third battery terminal between the positive/negative terminals (it's even marked positive):

Searching the part number on the chip yielded a [Thermal Cutoff Device](/docs/hc.pdf) [(linkrot)](https://www.bourns.com/docs/Product-Datasheets/HC.pdf) that we can "safely" ignore for the graft. I'm starting to sympathize with dell, but I'm in too deep now.

Solution: Spot welding, not soldering[^2].
