        <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Every week I host an open source meetup in Seattle. My friends are always bringing in project laptops to fix up, dual boot linux with, whatever. There&rsquo;s a light-hearted atmosphere, food, people coming and going.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/motherboards.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>You can do everything right when e.g. replacing a battery, and end up breaking the motherboard. ASD wristbands and bags, step-by-step manufacturer-supplied teardown instructions, magnetic isolation, the works; the board still undergoes a lot of physical stress in some replacements.</p>
<p>About half the time we replace a minor component, we put things back together, and there&rsquo;s no POST! And these boards aren&rsquo;t modular; typically we can only salvage ram and a wifi card. So a $30 battery replacement becomes a $100+, 3+ week affair waiting for shipping. Too much to expect from someone too poor to just buy a new laptop, and too mysterious for the wrong kind of nerd to ignore.</p>
<p>We are only concerned with cases where:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PC was fully functional before we replaced a part, and failed after</li>
<li>Reassembling with the old part didn&rsquo;t fix the problem</li>
<li>Nobody forgot to ground themselves, unplug all power sources, account for all screws, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common wisdom is that component failure is generally due to electrostatic discharge (ESD), electrostatic overstress (EOS), and cooling issues.</p>
<h3 id="hypotheses">Hypotheses</h3>
<h4 id="1-replugging-internals-disturbs-ports">1. Replugging internals disturbs ports</h4>
<p>Imagine a scenario where dust accumulates in an internal port. It&rsquo;s never been unplugged, so disassembly lets potentially conductive dust inside. Internal ports don&rsquo;t have the lifespan expectations that external ports do. 10%?</p>
<h4 id="2-years-of-thermal-cycling-weaken-connectors-enough-to-fail-silently-after-reseating">2. Years of thermal cycling weaken connectors enough to fail silently after reseating</h4>
<p>These laptops accumulate so much dust that thermal throttling slows them down. Giving this 20%.</p>
<h4 id="3-moisture-introduceddust-disturbed-in-the-replacement-process-shorted-a-component">3. Moisture introduced/dust disturbed in the replacement process shorted a component</h4>
<p>Idk about this. 5%.</p>
<h4 id="4-bad-replacement-part">4. Bad replacement part</h4>
<p>I once had a DVI cable that ate 2 monitors due to faulty wiring before I could establish a cause. Normally this would be negligible but there&rsquo;s a lot of specifically battery counterfeit out there that can damage a motherboard. Maybe 5%?</p>
<h4 id="5-someone-did-something-wrong-without-knowing-it">5. Someone did something wrong without knowing it</h4>
<p>This has to be a substantial portion; assuming a ground/screw/etc was taken care of that wasn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll guess 25% because I&rsquo;m only human.</p>
<p>All told, this leaves about 1/3 of causes unexplained even by my guessing. Eventually I&rsquo;ll fill up my wall of dead laptop motherboards and get in there with more than just a multitool.</p>
<p>Sidenote: I have to figure out git lfs if I&rsquo;m going to host images on my site long-term.</p>
