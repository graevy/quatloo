      <description>Background Back in November I told my friends I&amp;rsquo;d do advent of code with them this year. I was going to do it entirely in Rust, because I kept talking about how much I wanted to learn more Rust to actually use it for systems programming. I fell a bit behind, caught up some days, and promised I&amp;rsquo;d catch up when I had more free time over the holidays. String processing was a little weird, but manageable; I spent evenings sipping tea and staring at std::vec::Vec and std::str to replicate the kind of pythonic 10-line algorithms I usually write for leetcode problems.</description>

      <description>Source to Deploy, directly I had enough free time to throw together this project site over the holidays. Without any real networking knowledge, I snagged on basics for hours; the worst by far1 was the webhooks. Ultimately, the 3 guides I referenced didn&amp;rsquo;t mention that network points and nodes (?) have their own rules for port forwarding:
Cloudflare has a very short whitelist2, Most distros, and particularly webhost distro images (I imagine), require port whitelisting through iptables/nftables backends typically managed with ufw Basically, any point along the source -&amp;gt; browser pipe can block you.</description>
